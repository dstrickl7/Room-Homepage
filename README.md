### Challenges

The changing content was the most challenging aspect of this project for me because I wasn't sure what to do or where to start. I figured I wasn't ready for this challenge yet and decided to focus on a project of lower difficulty. During that time I came up with some ideas of how to approach the rotating content. I decided to use a combination of CSS and Javascript to display the images and text. For the text I decided to use the toggle feature paired with looping through an array and for the images I looped through an array. Once I decided on this approach, my next struggle was properly toggling the content. Once I worked out the logic, everything fell into place.

### Continued development

I still feel like I don't have the strongest grasp on flexbox or grid and feel like I only have a basic understanding of it. I would like to develop that further. I also would like to continue using SASS. After learning it for my last project, I've fallen in love with it. The modules, the variables, the mixins just make everything so easy to organize and work with.
